SQL Server 2016 does away with these unintuitive trace flags by adding new ALTER DATABASE commands:

ALTER DATABASE SET MIXED_PAGE_ALLOCATION ON (or OFF, which is the new default behavior)

ALTER DATABASE MODIFY FILEGROUP [myfilegroup] AUTOGROW_ALL_FILES (or AUTOGROW_SINGLE_FILE, which is still the default)

Plus, file sizes and growths have new sensible defaults: both data and log files default to 8MB in size, and auto-growth is 64MB. (One could argue that 8MB is still on the small side, but some software-as-a-service companies with one client per database still manage to pack thousands of tiny databases per instance.)

So far, so good: the trace flag behaviors are well-tested, almost as if they’ve been in beta for a decade. It’s just that now some of the good ones are on by default, like 1118 and 2371, and the rest are easier to configure safely.


SQL Server 2016 brings a few new fun options with a new command, ALTER DATABASE SCOPED CONFIGURATION. Now, for each database, you can set:

MAXDOP – the value of your choice
LEGACY_CARDINALITY_ESTIMATION – on or off
ONLINE_OPERATION_DEFAULT – on or off
PARAMETER_SNIFFING – on or off
QUERY_OPTIMIZER_HOTFIXES – on or off
