global temp, local temp, table variables
global temp tables remain as long as some session references it
temp tables have statistics
temp tables have no undo/redo
can create indexes and constraints on temp tables
local temp tables remain for the session that created it
not always consistent which is faster - truncate table before ending session or letting sql server cleanup
table variables are not just memory only - they write to memory and disk
table variables do not have statistics, don't have to worry about recompiles, optimizer always assumes table has only one row
table variables cannot have indexes but can have constraints
table variables only last during the same batch

multi-statement table valued function (terrible performance)
common table expression
